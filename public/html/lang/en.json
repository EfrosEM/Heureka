    "heuristicas": "The diagram shows the name of each heuristic next to a decorative icon.",
    "heuristicas1": "1. System status visibility",
    "descripcion1": "The system must always keep users informed of what is happening, reacting to their actions appropriately and in a reasonable time.",
    "heuristicas2": "2. Correspondence between the system and the real world",
    "descripcion2": "The system must speak the user's language, using words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. It follows real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural, logical order.",
    "heuristicas3": "3. Control and freedom for the user",
    "descripcion3": "Users often choose features by mistake, so they will need a clearly marked \"emergency exit\" to exit the unwanted state without having to go through a tedious dialog. Supports undo and redo.",
    "heuristicas4": "4. Consistency and standards",
    "descripcion4": "Users should not have to wonder if different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow the conventions of the development platform.",
    "heuristicas5": "5. Error prevention",
    "descripcion5": "Even better than good error messages is a design that prevents the error from ever occurring. Eliminate error-prone conditions or detect them and give the user the option to confirm the action before performing it.",
    "heuristicas6": "6. Promote recognition over memory",
    "descripcion6": "Minimizes the user's cognitive load by making objects, actions and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one dialog box in a subsequent one. Instructions for using the system should be visible or easily accessible when necessary.",
    "heuristicas7": "7. Flexibility and efficiency of use.",
    "descripcion7": "Accelerators (hidden from the novice user) often speed up interaction for expert users, so that the system can serve both experienced and inexperienced users. Allows users to tailor frequent actions to suit themselves.",
    "heuristicas8": "8. Minimalist aesthetics and design",
    "descripcion8": "Dialogues should not contain irrelevant or normally unnecessary information. Each extra unit of information within a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and decreases their relative visibility.",
    "heuristicas9": "9. Help recognize, diagnose and recover from failures",
    "descripcion9": "Error messages should be expressed in plain language (without error codes), state the problem precisely, and constructively suggest a solution.",
    "heuristicas10": "10. Help and documentation",
    "descripcion10": "Although it is best that the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to offer help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focus on the user's task, list the steps to follow, and not be too long.",
